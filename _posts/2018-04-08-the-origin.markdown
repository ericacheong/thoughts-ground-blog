I have so many ideas in mind. Why donâ€™t I write these thoughts out as a blog and post on web?

A normal sane person would have created a wordpress account and throw in a custom domain and then start writing. I am crazy about control and precision so I start thinking the whole thing through and going through all my options. 

Here comes thougthground.xyz

My dumping ground of thoughts.

What do I want from this blog?

* a full stack site that I can control all layout, coding and data
* very clean interface that focus text only. Images should be second-class citizen

As usual as my any projects, self-doubts and questions kick in. 

* should my thinking process be part of the public content?
  * content should be edited and curated, but the thinking process can be edited to be a tutorial article
* what should a blog post teach or preach? 
  * Just stop to be perfect and start doing (this was for me.) 
* should this blog allow comment?
  * think about it later. probably I will add [disqus](https://disqus.com)
